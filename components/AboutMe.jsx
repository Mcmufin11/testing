                    Hi , my name is Ng Kah Jun and I am 20 years old. Currently, I am still pursuing my degree in cyber security at Asia Pacific University. 
I have learned programming languages such as Python, C Programming and Java. I have also learned additional domain specific programming language such as MSSQL and R programming. Additionally, I have acquired skills to operate on Operating System such as Kali Linux and Ubuntu. 
Besides that, I am a good follower as I will  go over my limits and finish the tasks given to me. I am also a curious person as I am not afraid to ask questions to improve my skills and myself as a person. 
I like to play badminton every week as i believe it is a very good stress reliever after a long and hectic week
